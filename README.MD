# PET/CT Inpainting Project

## Project Introduction

This project is developed to address the discomfort experienced by patients during PET/CT scans, where maintaining the upper arm (superman) position for an extended period is challenging. When the decision is made by radiologists or physicians to lower the patient's arm during the scan, the overlap of the arm's bone position with the liver can result in liver signal becoming noise due to bone artifacts. To mitigate this issue, we have created this repository to apply inpainting deep learning to restore the signal to its original liver signal.

## Key Features

- Inpainting deep learning technology for patients finding it difficult to maintain the upper arm position during PET/CT scans.
- Minimization of noise for accurate image reconstruction.
